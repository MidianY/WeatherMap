# Mapbox example

Tim made this repo while following a partial gearup guide. This repo should *not* be substituted for doing the gearup! 

Note: you'll get your _own_ default public token from mapbox; Tim's isn't pushed to this repository. While it is a public token, it's vulnerable to denial-of-service attack with the goal of causing lecture or gearup issues...
