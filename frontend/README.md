# Project Details 
- At a high level, this project is made up of the `frontend` and `backend` directores. The fronetnd directory contains the UI where the user can make queries and the backend process API's for different commands. 

- Midian Yoseph (myoseph), Santiago Cortabarria (scortaba)

- Estimated Time : 10 hours

- Github Link: https://github.com/cs0320-f2022/integration-myoseph-scortaba.git


# Backend 
The `backend` direcotry conaints code that was adapted from `Sprint 2` with an additional `geodata` endpoint. This new endpoint calculates the number of rows and columns in a csv file. Apart from this, the backend logic remains unchanged and for more details you can follow this link: https://github.com/cs0320-f2022/sprint-2-afreema9-myoseph.git 


# Frontend
 
# How to Run the Program 
To be able to run this project you must have 2 terminals running.

In the first terminal navigate to the `backend` directory and run the `main` method in the `Server` class. Upon doing so you will see a message in the terminal indicating that the "**Server has Started**".

In the second terminal navigate to the `frontend` directory and type `npm start` to launch the fronted in your browser.


# Tests
Because most of the `backend` code was adapted from a previous sprint, tests for the validity of `get`, `stats`, and `weather` are handled in the that direcotry of this project. To run those tests navigate to the `backend` directory and run `mvn test`

To run the tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory and in the terminal run `npm test`.
